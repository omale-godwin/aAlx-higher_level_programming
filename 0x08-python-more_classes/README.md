## 101-N-Queen

1. The function is_safe(board, row, col) checks if it is safe to place a queen at the given position (row, col) on the board. It iterates through all the previously placed queens (from row 0 to row-1) and checks if there is any conflict with the current position. It checks for conflicts in the same column, the same diagonal (both left and right diagonals). If any conflict is found, it returns False, indicating that it's not safe to place a queen at that position. Otherwise, it returns True.
